# igauto
STEPS

1. Run npm init and add index.js. Mine is provided for reference but you may want to tweak it. 
2. Install dependencies with  ` npm install --save dotenv puppeteer instauto `

You will have to create a .env file to store your environment variables to log in to Instagram. It goes without saying but seriously, don't share that info with anyone. 

pro-tip
Don't forget to specify the initial user whose followers you want to target.
